                <p class="main-txt">I've been using Nitraflex for some time now and I can honestly say it's one of the best, if not, the best pre-workout I have tried so far. It's one of those pre-workouts that will do the trick for just about anyone, from the beginner lifter, to the seasoned veterans of the church of iron. Although if you've only been in the gym for a few months and you've never tried a pre-workout before, I would recommend half-scooping it for a while. From there, once your body has gotten used to it, or you need that extra kick then you can go ahead and full-scoop. I want to share with you 5 reasons why I think Nitraflex is great and why you should try it out if you haven't already. If you are interested in purchasing this pre-workout, I've provided a link to both <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JH6DKVS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=themarketpal-20&linkId=6d9de026a82212bae2757a73156ab035&language=en_US" class="link" target="_blank">Amazon</a> and the <a href="https://gatsport.com/products/nitraflex-burn" class="link" target="_blank">Gat Sports website</a> for you to purchase on whichever one you prefer.</p>
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li class="title-txt">It's a Thermogenic Pre-workout</li>
                    <p class="main-txt">The first reason we'll cover on why I like this pre-workout, is that it's thermogenic. For those of you who don't know what this is or what it does, basically all it does is raise your body temperature so that you get hotter. This can definitely be a good thing for those of you who like being hot when you workout, like myself. I personally like being hot when I'm working out for a couple of reasons; the better blood flow and pump. This increase in body temperature in the pre-workout, comes from 4 ingredients: L-carnitine, green tea leaf extract, cassia bark powder, and cayenne pepper fruit extract. Both the cassia bark powder (cinnamon powder)</p>
                    <div class="img-container">
                        <img src="img/pexels-thermometer-image.jpg" alt="Image of thermometer from pexels.com" class="img-insert">
                    </div>
                    <p class="main-txt">and cayenne pepper fruit powder are there mainly just to raise your body temperature (kind of like when you eat something spicy but not to the same extent). Green tea leaf extract has been used to reduce the risk of cancer, low cholesterol, and other health risks, but I'm not quite sure how it'll benefit you as a lifter. Feel free to check out the <a href="https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-76714/green-tea-leaf-extract-oral/details" class="link" target="_blank"></a>link I've provided for an article on this ingredient. There is also the <a href="https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-1026/l-carnitine" class="link" target="_blank">L-carnitine</a>, which basically just produces energy from fat. You'll be hotter, sweating more, and turning a bit more of that extra fat into energy, which is an added bonus..</p>
                    <br>
                    <li class="title-txt">Blood Flow and Pump</li>
                    <div class="img-container">
                        <img src="img/pexels-anush-gorak-1431282.jpg" alt="" class="img-insert">
                    </div>
                    <p class="main-txt">The improvement in your blood flow primarily comes from the <a href="https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/l-citrulline-uses-and-risks#1" class="link" target="_blank">L-citrulline</a>, L-citrulline malate, <a href="https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-875/l-arginine" class="link" target="_blank">L-arginine malate</a>, and the thermogenic factor of Nitraflex. According to <a href="https://www.webmd.com/" class="link" target="_blank">WebMD's</a> article on both L-citrulline and L-arginine, both are non-essential amino acids that boost nitric oxide production in the body. L-citrulline breaks down into L-arginine, which then results in more nitric oxide production. This improves your blood circulation by opening up the blood vessels, which allows more blood and more nutrients to be supplied to the muscle as you train. Now, this doesn't mean that full-scooping Nitraflex everyday is going to make you bigger, it's a supplement, not TREN. When you pair this up with the thermogenic ingredients, you're most likely going to see a slight increase in the quality of your pumps.</p>
                    <br>
                    <li class="title-txt">Improves Your Focus While You Train</li>
                    <p class="main-txt">The third thing on the list that makes me like this pre-workout, is the boost in focus. It's not something tremendous, but it will be noticeable enough while you workout. The boost in focus comes from the L-theanine that's in Nitraflex. L-theanine is an amino acid, that according to WebMD, is  found in tea and some mushrooms. What this ingredient basically does, is improve your mental function and focus. It's useful for reducing stress, anxiety, and mental impairment, according to the same resource. I'm not a medical expert, so if you'd like to see a more in-depth description of what this does, you can simply go to the link I've provided either in this section or in the <a href="#resources" class="link">resources</a> section of this post. All you really need to know is that it'll help you improve your mental focus while you train, which should give you that little extra you may need to get a better mind to muscle connection.</p>
                    <br>
                    <li class="title-txt">Increases Your Endurance During Your Workout</li>
                    <p class="main-txt">Up next, is the boost in endurance you get. This one comes from the beta-alanine and this same ingredient is also responsible for the tingling sensation most people get when they take supplements with this ingredient in it. I personally prefer supplements with less beta-alanine in them because I'm not a fan of the tingling sensation, personally. But a lot of vendors of pre-workouts love putting a considerable amount in there because that tingling sensation will make you think "Oh, it's working" (C4 cough cough). But it will give you a nice little extra boost in endurance which could be helpful for getting 1-2 extra reps in your sets. It won't make you hit a new PR though, again, it's a supplement, not roids.</p>
                    <br>
                    <li class="title-txt">The Number of Servins You Get For the Good Price</li>
                    <img src="img/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4386417.jpg" alt="Picture of someone handing money from pexels.com" class="img-insert">
                    <p class="main-txt">Another great thing about Nitraflex is the price for what you're getting. I've tried other good pre-workouts in the past, but I've seen some of them come in a 20 serving container for $40. Nitraflex is one of those really good bang for your buck pre-workouts that will not fail you (unless of course you're a crossfitter. If you are, you don't need supplements, you need rehab.).</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2 class="title-txt">Bonus #6</h2>
                    <br>
                    <li class="title-txt">The Flavor</li>
                    <p class="main-txt">The next reason why I really like this pre-workout is the flavor. If you've been in the gym long enough, chances are you've taken a pre-workout with an unpleasant taste. Some people out there may not care what their pre-workout tastes like as long as it gets the job done. If that's you, more power to you but I prefer something that doesn't taste like sh*t. I personally prefer the pink lemonade flavor but the blue raspberry is good as well. It's mainly just personal preference and there's no difference between them other than taste.</p>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p class="main-txt">In summary, Nitraflex, by far, remains my favorite pre-workout. This is primarily for the reasons I've listed above among a few others and it's a really good pre-workout overall for a good price. It is worth noting though, the ingredients in this pre-workout will not be life changing. It's the combination of all of them that makes it good and just because one ingredient was found to improve mental focus and stress, doesn't mean you'll turn into a monk and become enlightened all of a sudden and you'll be having perfect workouts every time. It's all about the hard work you put in the gym that will ultimately matter long-term. Just wanted to mention that very quickly. But again, overall, amazing pre-workout and I would recommend it to anybody. You'll may just have to adjust how much you take according to what you have and have not taken before.</p>
