                <!-- Main content for the blog post -->
                <p class="main-txt">If you've been taking pre-workouts for some time now and pay attention to the labels, you may have noticed that a good number of pre-workouts out there contain an ingredient called beta-alanine. Beta-alanine is a selling point in a good number of pre-workouts out there and you can often find it towards the top of the labels in the pre-workouts that you take. A lot of lifters take a pre-workout that contains beta-alanine in it but don't really know what it's advertised to be able to do for you in the gym, what it actually does for you, and what it doesn't do for you. I want to share with you what I have found with the research I have done. I've linked the information that has been the most useful to me while looking for some answers to my questions if you want to check it out for yourself. Feel free to do your own research as well if you want to know about this supplement/ ingredient more in depth.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="title-txt">What It's Supposed To Do and Why People Take It</h2>
                <p class="main-txt">Beta-alanine is supposed to increase your endurance when you're training in the gym. But this isn't only for weightlifters like you and me, it can also be used by people such as runners. This supplement or ingredient (depending on if you take it with a pre or as a separate supplement), as I said, is advertised as being able to help you do more in the gym without feeling fatigued as quickly. So it's basically just going to help you do more without your muscles getting tired. According to an article by <a href="https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/beta-alanine-uses-and-risks" class="link" target="_blank">WebMD</a>, this increase in endurance comes from beta-alanine's boost in the production of a dipeptide molecule called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnosine" class="link" target="_blank">carnosine</a>. Carnosine is made up of amino acids, beta-alanine, and histidine. What does this special molecule have anything to do with lifting? Well, carnosine is found in high quantities in the muscle and brain tissues in your body. A higher production of this is said to regulate the build up of acid in the muscles, which according to the same WebMD source, is a primary cause of muscle fatigue. This is why it's advertised to boost your performance in the gym.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="title-txt">What It Doesn't Do</h2>
                <p class="main-txt">The issue with this however, is that these studies have been small and there hasn't been enough scientific evidence to back up these claims that beta-alanine will actually boost your athletic performance. What it will do, is allow you to lift weights, run, or whatever other type of training you do, for longer periods of time. It will not actually boost your performance. You may be able to go into the gym and do your typical chest day for the 5th time this week, but it will not make you add 10 more pounds to your bench just for taking it. All it will do is allow you do bench what you normally do without feeling as tired. It will not make you any stronger in the gym. I come to this conclusion due to the lack of scientific testing that has been done on the subject from what I've found.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="title-txt">What I Don't Like About It</h2>
                <p class="main-txt">Another thing beta-alanine will do, which I don't like that much, personally, is give you the tingling sensation you get when you take a pre-workout that contains beta-alanine. According to <a href="https://www.carnosyn.com/blog/why-does-beta-alanine-make-me-tingle/" class="link" target="_blank">carnosyn.com</a>, this sensation is called paresthesia. This sensation is not harmful but I'm personally not a fan of it. But, if you do like walking around the gym looking like a crackhead because you're trying to scratch that sensation away, that's up to your personal preference. It is recommended that you take about 2-5 grams of this a day if you are taking it daily. Pre-workouts generally don't have that high a dosage. The ones I've taken have been under 2 grams. The sensation will vary from person to person, with some feeling it more than others. It also depends on the pre-workout you take. Some might have higher dosages of it or have a mix of ingredients that either increases or decreases this sensation. My experience with pre-workouts like C4, for example, compared to something like Nitraflex (my favorite pre-workout), is that C4 will give me a much greater tingling sensation, especially if I have not taken it in quite some time, while with Nitraflex, I don't really feel it that much, if at all most times. It depends on the pre-workout and the person.</p>
                <p class="main-txt">What I have found is that if you want to lessen or avoid the tingling sensation, you can either take it in smaller quantities throughout the day or taking what's called a sustained-release version of the supplement. What the sustained-release verison of it does is it releases the beta-alanine slowly in your body. The issue with this is that you'll most likely be taking it because it's an ingredient in your pre-workout, not as a separate supplement you take in your day, so neither of these is really a choice unless you get a pre-workout with sustained-release beta-alanine. I personally have not seen a pre-workout with a sustained-release version of beta-alanine but if you do find one you think is good, I'd like to know about it.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="title-txt">Final Thoughts and Conclusion</h2>
                <p class="main-txt">The purpose of beta-alanine is quite simple and easy to understand. All if basically does is allow you  to train longer by delaying the feelings of fatigue in the muscles. This is something you can definitely benefit from if you like longer training sessions. Some pre-workouts with beta-alanine will give you a very noticeable tingling sensation that generally will last a few minutes, others might not, or others might be hardly noticeable. A good example of a pre-workout that will do this is Cellucor C4. Nevertheless, this beta-alanine is a good thing to have in your pre-workout. It won't be anything life changing, but it may help you get in 1-2 extra reps and be in the gym longer compared to if you didn't take it. A good way to figure out if it works or not for this purpose, try taking a pre-workout with beta-alanine for one week and then take one without beta-alanine for another week and compare your results for those two weeks in terms of reps and how much time, on average, your workouts lasted.
